# Amazon Delivery Time Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts e-commerce delivery times based on factors like distance, traffic, weather, and agent performance.

The model is trained in a Google Colab notebook using regression algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and logged with MLflow. The final trained model is then deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Core Technologies:-

1. Python
